Both scripts downloads the highest quality possible up to 1080p 60fps. Code is customizable to download higher qualities.

Both of the scripts will create a file named "Videos" at the same path that it exists. Both scripts do/can feed the same file. When moved, they will create a new "Videos" file in the new location. 

Both code is implementable to an UI application. I was just too lazy to do it and i hate designing UI.


Setup:

1. Install everything in folder "Before launch" (Select "ADD to PATH" when installing Python)
2. Start the application depending on your demand. (By order, At once)
3. Input single or multiple URLs and press Enter twice.
4. Done.

Be aware that the method "At once" downloads them at once it it suppose to be. So ridiculous amount of video links can kill your internet if its not good enough.

# Known Issues
